# How to...

To see magic you need to:

1. `Install NodeJS and NPM`: [Here](http://www.w3resource.com/node.js/installing-node.js-windows-and-linux.php) is a tutorial for Windows and Linux hackers. For the OSX hackers please see [here](https://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/installing-node-js-on-macos/). Also you can use the amazing [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), but it's up to you. 

2. A code editor: I really love [Atom](https://atom.io/), but again, it's up to you.

3. Clone the repository (duh!)

4. In your terminal, on the cloned repository directory, please run `npm install`.

5. Then run `npm run dev`.

6. Go to [this URL](http://localhost:8080/)

7. If you see ![this image](http://i.imgur.com/lH9VQeB.png) you're DONE!

8. If you can't see the step 7 image, please submit an issue and I'll help.
